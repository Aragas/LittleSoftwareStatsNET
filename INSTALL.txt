1) Download The Library

The first step is to download our library from http://getlittleapps.com/little-software-stats/libraries/csharp-latest.zip

2) Include The Library

Using a Windows Forms Project that was created, add the “Library” folder to your solution. Next, you’ll want to open up Config.cs and modify it so it works with your Little Software Stats.

3) Integrate with your software

Now you’ll want to integerate Little Software Stats by calling it using your software code. The file "Example.cs" shows basic usage of the library. There is also an example Windows Forms C# project already made which is included with the library. You can use that to test and make sure that your Little Software Stats is receiving data properly.
